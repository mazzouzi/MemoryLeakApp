# MemoryLeakApp
A sample app showing different kind of memory leaks and their solutions.

Make sure to check the source code to understand the concept of each memory leak.

The app is working with LeakCanary so every time you play the "leak" scenario on the app,
LeakCanary displays a toast once it detects the leak.

Don't forget to clean LeakCanary leak history before playing a new scenario.

Enjoy and feel free to contribute :)
